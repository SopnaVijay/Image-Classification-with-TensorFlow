# Image Classification with TensorFlow

This project demonstrates how to build and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images using TensorFlow. The model is trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset, which contains 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes.

## Project Overview

- **Data**: CIFAR-10 dataset
- **Model**: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- **Framework**: TensorFlow and Keras
